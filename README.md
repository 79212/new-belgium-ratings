# New Belgium Beer Ratings Analysis

A Juptyer notebook for a scraping, data analysis, and data visualization project that was used in [this Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jeff.hale6436#!/vizhome/NewBelgiumBeerRatings/NewBelgiumBeerAdvocateRatings). 

The interactive dashboard shows all New Belgium beers with over 300 reviews by average Beer Advocate rating and other characteristics.

If the notebook isn't displaying correctly, you can see it at binder: [https://notebooks.gesis.org/binder/jupyter/user/discdiver-new-belgium-ratings-2t2ilqge/notebooks/scrape_beer.ipynb](https://notebooks.gesis.org/binder/jupyter/user/discdiver-new-belgium-ratings-2t2ilqge/notebooks/scrape_beer.ipynb)

See [my Medium article in Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/tableau-basics-in-six-minutes-35b50ec9ae9b) that uses this dashboard for an introductory guide to Tableau.
